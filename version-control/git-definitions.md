* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
 - Version control is the act of saving multiple versions the project as you make changes. This is useful because you can always roll back to a previous save point. 



* What is a branch and why would you use one?
 - A branch is a "different timeline" per project. You should use branched to keep your main file "always working and clean" All new branches would be working on updates to the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 - A commit is the save point that you push to your git repo.
 - A good commit message is a good description of what you just committed to the repo 

* What is a merge conflict?
 - A merge conflict is when  a line of code is changed by 2 more people. Git will get confused on which line is correct
