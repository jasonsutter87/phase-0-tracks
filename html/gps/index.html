<!--
1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?

A1 > Semantic tags give full meanings what are behind the tag. For example an header tag. Would always go up top in a section or article. It would be the "headline" of the section.

A2 >  The brower read the display tags top down, building out the page in that order.

A3 > I learned that Sublime is more powerful than a basic text editor. I Think ill create more boilerplates for different projects. 

A4 >  I thought switching off between driving and navigating to be the hardest. Also finding out the location to save the snippets
