##Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

> it defeats the security model that's been in place for years. Applications are meant to be run with non-administrative security (or as mere mortals) so you have to elevate their privileges to modify the underlying system. For example you wouldn't want that recent crash of Rhythmbox to wipe out your entire $HOME/Music directory due to a bug. Or that vulnerability that was just posted in ProFTPD to allow an attacker to gain a ROOT shell.

> Its just good practice on any operating system to run your applications on a user level and leave administrative tasks to the root user, and only on a per-need basis.
