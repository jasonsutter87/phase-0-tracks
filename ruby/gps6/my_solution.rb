# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: jacqueline phan].
# We spent [1.75] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#

require_relative = 'state_data'


# require_relative: is from the same directory as the current file you are working on.
#require: pulls information that not location in the same directory and you need to write the full file path. 
    #require_relative: pulls the information from the state_data file (hash)
    #require_relative is a convenient subset of require:
    #require_relative('path')
    #equals: require(File.expand_path('path', File.dirname(__FILE__)))

class VirusPredictor
  
  # initialize set up the program with instance variable thhat can be access through out the class.
  # Its pulling the variable from the arugements.
  #set up parameters for the class
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end

  #virus effects is running two methods predicted_deaths, speed_of_spread. 
  #The variable that get passed throught predicted_deaths, and speed_of_spread are set in the 
  #initialize method.

  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths
    speed_of_spread

    def predicted_deaths
      factor = case @population_density
        when 0...50 then 0.05

        when 100...150 then 0.2
        when 150...200 then 0.3
        else 0.4
      end
      number_of_deaths = (@population * factor).floor
    print "#{@state} will lose #{number_of_deaths} people in this outbreak"
    end
  
  # sets the speed of the virus spread by an if/else statement. if the density is high, 
  #the speed is slow, but if the density is low, the speed is higher. Prints results
  
#   def speed_of_spread #in months
#     # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
#     # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.

    def speed_of_spread
        speed = case @population_density

# DRIVER CODE
 # initialize VirusPredictor for each state

STATE_DATA.each do |state,info|
   state = VirusPredictor.new(state, STATE_DATA[state][:population_density], STATE_DATA[state][:population])
   state.virus_effects

# Reflection Section

# On your own, add a commented reflection section to yourmy_solution.rb file. Answer the following questions in your reflection:

# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# > The outer hash STATE_DATA had a {"string" => {}, next..} format while the inner hash had a
#  {symbol: value, next..} format. 
#
# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# >  require_relative pulls the class from a file in a the same folder, while require pulls from class that
#    isnt in the same folder. 
#   
# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# > do loop, while loop, make a new instance and pull values, and search by keys or by values. 

# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# > nothing stood out. it wasnt until our guide helped us that declaring the variables were not needed.

# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# > That i dont need to delcare my variables in creating methods if it is already an intance varible.
